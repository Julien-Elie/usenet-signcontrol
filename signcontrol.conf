# The path to the required GPG executable.  GnuPG <https://www.gnupg.org/>

# Its path is usually "C:\Progra~1\GNU\GnuPG\gpg.exe" or "/usr/bin/gpg".

# Whether compatibility with MIT PGP 2.6.2 (or equivalent) should be kept.
# Though this is now fairly obsolete, a few news servers still haven't been
# updated to be able to process newer and more secure signing algorithms.
# Such servers do not recognize recent signing algorithms; however, current
# news servers may refuse to process messages signed with the insecure MD5
# algorithm.
# Possible values are "True", "False" or "Only" (default is "False").
# - When set to "True", signcontrol.py will generate two control articles: one
#   in a format compatible with MIT PGP 2.6.2 (or equivalent) and another with
#   a newer and more secure format.  Sending these two control articles will
#   then ensure a widest processing.
# - When set to "False", signcontrol.py will only generate control articles in
#   a newer and more secure format.
# - When set to "Only", signcontrol.py will only generate control articles in
#   a format compatible with MIT PGP 2.6.2 (or equivalent).
