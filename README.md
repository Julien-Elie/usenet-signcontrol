## Description

**signcontrol.py** is a Python script aimed at Usenet hierarchy
administrators so as to help them in maintaining the canonical lists
of newsgroups in the hierarchies they administer.

This script is also useful to manage PGP keys:  generation, import,
export, removal, and revokal.  It works on every platform on which
Python and GnuPG are available (Windows, Linux, etc.).

It enforces best practices regarding the syntax of Usenet control
articles.

Getting started is as simple as:

1. Downloading and installing Python ([http://www.python.org/](http://www.python.org/)).  However,
make sure to use Python 2.x because **signcontrol.py** is not compatible
yet with Python 3.x.
2. Downloading and installing GnuPG ([http://www.gnupg.org/](http://www.gnupg.org/)).
3. Downloading both the **signcontrol.py** script and its `signcontrol.conf`
configuration file.
4. Editing the `signcontrol.conf` configuration file so that the parameters
it defines properly fit your installation.
5. Running `python signcontrol.py`.

## Support

The **signcontrol.py** home page is:

It will always point to the current version of the script, and contains
instructions written in French.

## Source Repository

**signcontrol.py** is maintained using Git.  You can access the current
source by cloning the repository at:

https://github.com/Julien-Elie/usenet-signcontrol.git

or access it via the web at:

https://github.com/Julien-Elie/usenet-signcontrol

When contributing modifications, either patches or Git pull requests
are welcome.

## Configuration File

The following parameters can be modified in the `signcontrol.conf`
configuration file:

- **PROGRAM\_GPG**

The path to the GPG executable.  It is usually
`C:\Progra~1\GNU\GnuPG\gpg.exe` or `/usr/bin/gpg`.

- **PGP2\_COMPATIBILITY**

Whether compatibility with MIT PGP 2.6.2 (or equivalent) should
be kept.  Though this is now fairly obsolete, a few news servers still
haven't been updated to be able to process newer and more secure signing
algorithms.  Such servers do not recognize recent signing algorithms;
however, current news servers may refuse to process messages signed
with the insecure MD5 algorithm.

Possible values are `True`, `False` or `Only` (default is `False`).

When set to `True`, **signcontrol** will generate two control articles:
one in a format compatible with MIT PGP 2.6.2 (or equivalent) and
another with a newer and more secure format.  Sending these two control
articles will then ensure a widest processing.

When set to `False`, **signcontrol** will generate control articles in
only a newer and more secure format.

When set to `Only`, **signcontrol** will generate control articles in
only a format compatible with MIT PGP 2.6.2 (or equivalent).

- **ID**

The ID of the PGP key used to sign control articles.  Note that if you
do not already have a PGP key, it can be generated by **signcontrol.py**.
As for Usenet hierarchy management is concerned, the ID is usually a
mere e-mail.

- **MAIL**

The e-mail from which control articles are sent.  It is usually the ID
of the PGP key used to sign them.

- **HOST**

The host which appears in the second part of the Message-ID of control
articles generated.  It is usually the name of a news server.

- **ADMIN\_GROUP**

An existing newsgroup of the hierarchy (where checkgroups control
articles will be fed).  If an administrative newsgroup exists, put it.
Otherwise, any other newsgroup of the hierarchy will be fine.

- **NAME**

The name which appears in the From: header field.  You should only use
ASCII characters.  Otherwise, you have to MIME-encode it (for instance:
`=?ISO-8859-15?Q?Julien_=C9LIE?=`).

- **CHECKGROUPS\_SCOPE**

The scope of the hierarchy according to Section
5.2.3 of RFC 5537 (also known as USEPRO, available at
[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5537#section-5.2.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5537#section-5.2.3)).  For instance:
`fr` (for fr.\*), `de !de.alt` (for de.\* excepting de.alt.\*) or
`de.alt` (for de.alt.\*).

- **URL**

The URL where the public PGP key can be found.  If you do not have any,
leave `ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/pgpcontrol/README`.  If you want to add
more URLs (like the home page of the hierarchy), use a multi-line text
where each line, except for the first, begins with a tabulation.

- **NEWGROUP\_MESSAGE\_MODERATED**, **NEWGROUP\_MESSAGE\_UNMODERATED**,
**RMGROUP\_MESSAGE**

The message which will be written in the corresponding control article.
All occurrences of `$GROUP$` will be replaced by the name of the
newsgroup.

- **PRIVATE\_HIERARCHY**

Whether the hierarchy is public or private.  If it is private (that is
to say if it is intended to remain in a local server with private access
and if it is not fed to other Usenet news servers), the value should
be `True`, so that checkgroups control articles are not crossposted
to the news.admin.hierarchies newsgroup.  Possible values are `True`
or `False` (default is `False`).

- **CHECKGROUPS\_FILE**

The file which contains the current checkgroups.

- **ENCODING**

The encoding of control articles.  The default value is `ISO-8859-1`.
